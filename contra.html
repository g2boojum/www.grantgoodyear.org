            <p>In my somewhat less-than-copious spare time, I'm a contra dance caller.
            Contra dance is an American form of folk dance that is easy to learn (if you
            can walk, you can contra dance) and a lot of fun. For more information, see
            <a href="http://www.sbcds.org/contradance/whatis/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sbcds.org/contradance/whatis/</a>.</p>
            <p>I learned to contra dance in Rehoboth, MA, and I try to take a little bit of
            Rehoboth with me wherever I go. I have now contra danced in many parts of the
            U.S., but I have yet to find a dance crowd that is quite as enthusiastic and
            welcoming to newcomers as is the Rehoboth bunch. I started calling contra
            dances in Sacramento, CA in 1997, and became a regular caller (and dancer!) at
            the Houston, TX dances from 1999 to 2001. From 2001-2004 I regularly called for
            the Oconee Country Dancers in Walhalla, SC, with occasional calling around the
            Carolinas at River Falls and other venues, including a number of private
            parties. It seems that I'm moderately decent with large groups of people who
            have never danced before! In 2004 I returned to Houston, and I am once again a
            regular caller for <a href="http://hatds.org" rel="nofollow">HATDS</a>.</p>
            <p>I have a lot of fun both dancing and calling, occasionally, doing both at the
            same time! As a dancer, I'm generally recognized as that enthusiastic chap who
            chants "Men, Men, Men" during those rare men-only figures. As a dance
            choreographer I tend to write relatively simple dances that hopefully have a
            good storyline along with at least one special feature to keep the dance
            interesting. As a caller, my general strategy is to present a wide variety of
            dances -- dances that flow, high energy dances, traditional dances, goofy
            dances, non-contra dances such as triplets or squares, dance medleys,
            no-walk-through dances -- presented with enthusiasm and high-quality teaching.</p>
            <p>Incidentally, while I was in California I also picked up English Country
            dancing (I danced with the Merri Pryanksters in Renaissance fairs around the
            state) and Irish dancing, so I occasionally write and call English Country and
            Irish dances as well. Let me know if you need a caller. Until then, happy
            dancing!</p>

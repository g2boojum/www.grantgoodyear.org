==== ===== ===

There are many versions of Becky Hill's Druid Reel (as far as I can
tell).  This one is the version that I learned from Lisa Greenleaf.
What makes the dance special is the flow in A1 and A2.  What makes it
tricky is the one-step almd lf at the bottom of B1, which really should
come before the end of the phrase, not at the beginning of B2.  (Left to
their own devices, the dancers will tend to allemande at the beginning of B2
instead, which works, but makes the timing of the hey rather tighter
than it needs to be.)

(break)

This dance usually teeters on the edge of breaking down until it finally
does actually break down.  This time, however, it went very well, with
the dancers seeming to have no trouble at all.

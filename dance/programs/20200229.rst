* In that time period, rt & lf done entirely w/o hands, akin to circular hey

Money Musk (Traditional, 24-bar version)
----------------------------------------

Proper triple minor

==== ===== ===
A.   \( 8) 1s almd rt 1½
..   \( 4) 1s dn outside below 1 to
           center of lines of 3 on sides
..   \( 4) Lines bal fwd & bk

..   \( 4) Lines bal fwd & bk
..   \( 4) 1s almd rt ¾ to proper lines on sides
C.   \(16) 1s & 2s rt & lf thru (over and back)
==== ===== ===

Note that the A takes a lot longer to get to the fwd & bk than the dancers
expect. The same is true of the B almd, but that one's not as much
a problem. In both cases, careful calling can fix the timing.

                    <li>Written in honor of Fritz Barnes, who epitomizes the title</li>
                    <li>This dance was written such that it could be either a contra dance (as written), or an Irish reel by dancing the "sashays" with sevens instead of a slipping step (the move is then termed a "telescope") and replacing the balances with sets.</li>
                    <li>The music used for this dance really requires strong phrasing in A for the balances, which occur at the end rather than the beginning of the phrase. Two tunes that work very well are <em>Cold Frosty Morning</em> and <em>Kitchen Girl</em>.</li>

                    <li>Partners are in different sets during the Petronella twirls, so dancers should twirl either not quite once or once and a half for the second twirl to find their partners.</li>
                    <li>During the long lines in A1 dancers should make sure that they are facing a new couple. Alternatively, a reasonable variation is to replace the long lines with a circle to the left with new neighbors.</li>

                    <li>In A1 the first time through the dance couples circle left with the couple directly across from them. After the first time through, the circle left is with the couple on the <em>left diagonal</em> (a <em>bucksaw</em> progression).</li>
                    <li>In the Give-and-take the lines go forward two steps, partners take hands, the man gently pulls his partner to him while the lady ever-so-briefly resists and then acquiesces ("please don't lead me into that briar patch..."). In principle the give-and-take should only require four beats of music, allowing partners to have a 12-beat swing, but it will feel much more natural to dancers to take 6 beats instead. My view is that the issue of timing is essentially between the dancers and their partners.</li>
                    <li>The give-and-take, partner swing, and bucksaw progression were liberally stolen from the Larry Jennings' variant of Ted Sanella's dance <em>Salute to Larry Jennings</em>, which I learned from Lisa Greenleaf. For the first four years that I called this dance it didn't have a name. I finally named it at the 2003 Buffalo Bayou dance weekend in 2003 when Lisa Greenleaf asked for the dance but refused to accept it without a name.</li>
                    <li>This dance is surprisingly easy for dancers.</li>
                    <li><em>Scollay's Reel</em> and <em>Balkan Reel</em> work well.</li>

                    <li>This dance is almost as much of a game as it is a dance, since I deliberately designed this dance so that it would be common for dancers to <em>not</em> have a partner at the end of B2. Thus, they would have to find a new partner from the "lost-and-found" in the center.</li>
                    <li>Experienced dancers have to be told up-front that the pull-by in B2 does <strong>not</strong> start a grand right and left.</li>
                    <li>I frequently use this dance with beginners because it's easy, lots of fun, and it sneakily gets across the idea that when something goes "wrong" in a dance, the dancers can fix it.</li>

                    <li>I wrote this dance in honor of Linda Leslie, the caller who first taught me to dance. The stars in B2 are there because Linda calls "Star" so wonderfully.</li>
                    <li>I intended this dance to be a relatively straight-forward gender-free dance. In fact, I frequently call this dance by requesting that the dancers find partners of the same gender (thanks to Lisa Greenleaf for giving me that idea), and asking each "couple" to decide who will play the gent's role, and who will play the lady's role. With some dancers there can be a lot of initial resistance to the idea, but they invariably have a lot of fun once the dance actually starts. (From a sneaky-caller perspective, this trick is also a great way for a caller to emphasize some of the finer details about the swing to the more experienced dancers who tend to tune out the caller when swings are described to beginners.)</li>
                    <li>This dance is such a simple glossary dance that I'm sure that many people must have written and used this dance before me, but I don't recall seeing it anywhere.</li>

                    <li>I wrote this dance as a way to easily teach basic dance moves, but I generally use it just for assessment.</li>
                    <li>If you know your dancers, you might want to consider alternating 1s swinging and 2s swinging in B2 throughout the dance.</li>
                    <li>Another variation is to replace B1 with (8) right and left through across followed by a butterfly whirl, and (8) promenade back.</li>
